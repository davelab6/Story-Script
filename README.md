# Story-Script
Story Script is a handwritten typeface designed by Ben Buysse, in collaboration with Lana Roulhac, Senior Creative Director at FullStory, a digital experience intelligence platform. Story Script was designed to capture the lighthearted spirit of our culture while clean, intentional lines for improved readability and sophistication over traditional handwritten typefaces. When paired with a sans serif it creates a relationship that balances humanity and clarity. The result is an honest, and approachable typeface that can be used at a variety of sizes, while retaining its personality and distinction.

It was drawn at an angle that places reverse emphasis on strokes giving it a non-traditional weight balance, while also upholding the characteristics that make each letterform recognizable.

Tension and balance are central themes, combining the imperfection of handwriting and the precision of printed letters. Individuality is met with consistency. Unlike qualities are brought together in harmony that make for a unique typographic expression.

With over 700 glyphs, the typeface supports 25 Latin languages and includes 2 sets of stylistic alternates that offer more variation.
